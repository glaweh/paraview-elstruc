Paraview macros for interfacing with electronic structure codes
===============================================================
Paraview is a powerful tool for graphical representation and data analysis.
These macros simplify common visualization tasks in the context of 
electronic structure codes, such as data import and the setup of an initial
visualization pipeline, which simplifies common data analysis and
visualization tasks.

The present macros are intended for data on direct-space grids, such as
electron densities, alongside a sphere-representation of atoms.

Prerequisits
============
- Paraview (macros were developed for, and tested in version 3.14.1)
- PyQt4 in your Paraview's python: I recommend installing paraview+pyqt via your
  package manager (apt-get install paraview python-qt4). You can also try the "Bad
  Hack" at the end of this README in order to integrate pyqt into paraview 
  binary distributions

Installing
==========
Use 'Macros/Add new macro' within Paraview to add pv_import.py and pv_supercell.py
to your Paraview.

Description of the macros
=========================
pv_import
---------
Performs the actual import and initial pipeline setup; required file formats are described in
section "Input files". When executing the macro, a file-selection dialog pops up, where you select
your 'prefix-data.vtk'; the other input filenames are implied from this selection.
1.
   a) setup of direct-space grid and lattice vectors from '${prefix}-data.vtk'
   b) import of data on grids from '${prefix}-data.vtk'
2. import of atomic positions and properties (Nuclear_charge/Covalent_radius)
   from '${prefix}-atoms.vtk
3. setup atom pipeline:
  a) placeholder for supercell setup (see: pv_supercell)
  b) box clip filter (so you can easily remove some atoms
     from the visualization)
  c) Paraview 'Glyph' Spheres representation:
     i) semi-transparent covalent-radius, colored by Nuclear_charge,
        invisible by default
    ii) opaque unit-radius, colored by Nuclear_charge
4. setup density pipeline
  a) placeholder for supercell setup (see: pv_supercell)
  b) Calculator filter: process data and select the _same_ array for
     all cutplanes (c).
  c) setup a set of cutplanes, all displaying the output of the Calculator filter
     (b), so to simultanously change the quantity displayed on all planes one just
     needs to modify the calculator formula (b).
     Cutplanes are defined by input files (see 'Input files'), in my QuantumEspresso
     output module, I define one plane perpendicular to each symmetry axis, and passing
     through at least one atom.
  You can attach custom visualizations, such as isosurfaces, threshold filters or volume
  renderers, to the 'Density Calculator' (4b).

pv_supercell
------------
As rather obvious from the name, it expands both densities and
atoms to regular supercells. 3 Dialogs pop up, asking the user to specify
X/Y/Z unit cell multipliers.
Fills 3a) and 4a) with "transform" filters to generate the replicas.

Input file formats
==================
pv_input takes its input from three files:
- ${prefix}-data.vtk
- ${prefix}-atoms.vtk
- ${prefix}-cutplanes.tsv
In the pv_input's file-open dialog, select your ${prefix}-data.vtk, the other two filenames are
implied by this filename.

  Coordinates
  -----------
  For all files, we assume cartesian coordinates within the primitive unit cell,
  corresponding to crystal coordinates [0:1).

  prefix-data.vtk
  ---------------
  Contains densities, or other data subject to the analysis within Paraview.
  I use "VTK Structured Grid", where the coordinates of each direct space grid
  point are explicitly given. This eases handling of grids with
  non-orthogonal lattice vectors, as well as anisotropic sampling.

  prefix-atoms.vtk
  ----------------
  Grid points are atomic positions ('VTK unstructured grid'), data on grid are
  atomic properties, such as nuclear charge Z or atomic radii.

  prefix-cutplanes.tsv
  --------------------
  Suggested cut planes to display the densities upon.
  One line per plane (6 columns, normal+point form), the first three values
  specifying the plane normal vector (conventionally a symmetry-axis vector) and the final
  three values specifying one point of the plane (I suggest an atomic position).

Bad Hack for installing PyQT4 into Paraview upstream builds
===========================================================
Assumption: upstream Paraview is installed in /opt/ParaView-4.3.1-Linux-64bit. Warning:
this is a HACK. (PV does not distribute QT headers,

1. Download and install SIP
---------------------------
  /opt/ParaView-4.3.1-Linux-64bit/bin/pvpython configure.py
  make
  sudo make install

2. Build PyQT4
--------------
Install your distribution's qt4 development packages (apt-get install libqt4-dev)
  /opt/ParaView-4.3.1-Linux-64bit/bin//pvpython configure-ng.py --sip=/opt/ParaView-4.3.1-Linux-64bit/lib/paraview-4.3/bin/sip
  make
  sudo make install
